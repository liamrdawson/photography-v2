 * TIP: Using a generic string as an index, TypeScript will complain that it can't guarantee that whatever string is passed into your function will actually match a property name on your interface.
 *      An excellent workaround for this that was introduced in TypeScript 2.1 is keyof. This allows you to explicitly type something as a key of a certain class/interface.
